/*
 * Web3.Storage API
 *
 * This documentation describes the HTTP API for [**Web3.Storage**](https://web3.storage), which allows you to quickly and easily build applications using decentralized data storage persisted by [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io) and available over [IPFS](https://ipfs.io).  You can also interact with this API using client libraries. See [**docs.web3.storage**](https://docs.web3.storage) for more information on using a client library, as well as a variety of other guides and how-tos for Web3.Storage as a whole.  ## API endpoint URL  The main public API endpoint URL for Web3.Storage is `https://api.web3.storage`. All endpoints described in this document should be made relative to this root URL. For example, to post to the `/car` endpoint, send your request to `https://api.web3.storage/car`.  ### Rate limits  This API imposes rate limits to ensure quality of service. You may receive a 429 \"Too many requests\" error if you make more than 30 requests with the same API token within a ten second window. Upon receiving a response with a 429 status, clients should retry the failed request after a small delay. To avoid 429 responses, you may wish to implement client-side request throttling to stay within the limits.
